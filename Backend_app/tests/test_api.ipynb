The Transformer takes a different approach by using attention mechanisms as the primary mechanism for drawing global dependencies between input and output.\\\\n\\\\n**The Transformer Architecture**\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe Transformer follows an encoder-decoder structure, but unlike other models, it uses self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The encoder has a stack of 6 identical layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The decoder also has a stack of 6 identical layers, with an additional sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.\\\\n\\\\n**Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention**\\\\n------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nSelf-attention is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence. The Transformer uses multi-head attention, which consists of several attention layers running in parallel. This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.\\\\n\\\\n**Experimental Results**\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, including a BLEU score of 41.8 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, which is a significant improvement over previous results. The Transformer also achieves a BLEU score of 28.4 on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, which is a new state-of-the-art result.\\\\n\\\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is a significant improvement over previous models, which required much longer training times to achieve similar results.\",\"title\":\"\",\"_id\":\"0\"}'"

      "-------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer follows an encoder-decoder structure, but unlike other models, it uses self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The encoder has a stack of 6 identical layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The decoder also has a stack of 6 identical layers, with an additional sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.\n",

      "Self-attention is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence. The Transformer uses multi-head attention, which consists of several attention layers running in parallel.
